    "Sol:\n",
    "Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.\n",
    "These almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures. This  will cover the\n",
    "above mentioned topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python list is mutable which means it can be modified after its creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The items of lists are enclosed within the square bracket [] and separated by the comma.\n",

    "2. Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuple is similar to lists but it is different in the way that the value of the items stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable i.e. the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed.\n",

    "3. Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection of data values used to store data values like a map.\n",

    "A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes are known as vertices, and the lines connecting two nodes are generally called nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "HashMap\n",

    "1. Design\n",
    "\n",
    "        The first stage is to identify the problem and thoroughly understand it. This is where it’s important\n",
    "you consult with everybody who has an interest in the problem. Speak with them and see how they\n",

    "This is also the point where you are going to flowchart and/or use pseudo code to work out the\n",
    "specific problems of solving the flow of operations within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "          Once you have the basic framework of the algorithm it’s time to start analyzing how efficient the\n",
    "code is in solving the problem. Algorithm design is fluid and subject to individual plans. This is a\n",
    "step that some programmers like to attack after they have coded the algorithm and run it through\n",
    "the compiler. Others prefer to examine it prior to writing the code and analyze results based on\n",
    "their expectations from the design stage.\n",
    "Either way, what you are doing is looking for the efficiency of the algorithm. Algorithms are\n",
    "measured in time and space for their efficiency. Look at the algorithm you’re designing and see\n",
    "how it works with different size data structures and what kind of time it takes to work through\n",
    "those structures. The problem here is deciding when the algorithm has reached maximum\n",
    "efficiency for the project and produces acceptable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement:_\n",
    "            Writing and coding the algorithm is the next step in the process. If you are the one writing the\n",
    "algorithm, then you need to write it in the coding language you understand the best. In order for\n",
    "you to know how to write the algorithm efficiently you have to know exactly what each line of\n",

    "4. Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "          Once the algorithm is designed and coded go back and experiment with different variables in the\n",
    "algorithm. Try and enter data that will make it fail or try and re-write the code to work it out most\n",
    "efficiently. Experimentation in algorithmic design is really just another step of the analyzing of the\n",
    "algorithm. Keep attacking the efficiency aspect until it executes as much data as necessary in the\n",
    "smallest amount of time. When you find flaws in what you have written or ways to write the code\n",
    "better, then go back to the design step and redesign the algorithm.\n",
    "The design and analysis of algorithms is a circular process. You may find yourself becoming\n",
    "involved in any one of the steps. An experiment on an existing algorithm might lead to a new\n",
    "design. Or a re-coding of an algorithm might lead to a more efficient execution. Wherever you find\n",
    "yourself, keep working towards the goal of efficiency of the algorithm."
